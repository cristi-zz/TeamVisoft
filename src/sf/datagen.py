"""
This file handles data generation.
Each routine should declare its own constant and check if the file already exists.

Ex: Take a sample out of train data
1) Create a constant TRAIN_DATA_SAMPLE_RANDOM_01 with a proprer file name
2) create a function that:
2.1 check if the file exists in input_dir. If exisits, exit
2.2 call the code that generates the function
2.3 save the data in out_dir

The same pattern should be repeated for all the importnat files. So when smb comes back after a while,
runs the datagen locally and he has all the recent developments.

#TODO: Take first 10-20K instances from the training set and save them. They will be used to test our feature extraction functions
# Save for now as a csv or sth, we'll see later on more advanced formats.

#TODO: Don't hack it, pull out functions that might be common (check file existence, etc)
